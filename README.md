# bus-mall

This is the BusMall rating system!

It is a rating system which allows users to click on a single preferred product out of a set to collect preference data.

After the series is complete, two bar graphs are displayed. The first shows that sessions preferences, and the latter shows aggregate data from all users.

Robert Radford, a colleague, had the great idea to use an object literal as a dictionary.

I implemented mine slightly differently than his, so that I could reinstantiate each obejct from the localStorage.
